/////
to-do:

front page
input stars
dish pictures
style infoBox
figure out why page length wont go down
auth
when there is no top dish, either hide it or give it a default value of some kind to display instead of having it be blank

//cool ideas for later:
bg area drops down animated when going from front page to place page, site logo on infobox transitions to place info
display or cycle through photos of highest rated dish on place page
user auth
google maps integration????
admin/mod stuff
display random top rated dishes on main page
add genre support / sort by genre?
search
options to sort by highest score, most reviewed, etc
get random comment from best dish to display with it on place.html, picture too?
